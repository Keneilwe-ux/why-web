## why did I choose web development

I want to be a web developer because I have been eager to know how apps and websites are created. we live in the world where technology control most of the things which I also want to take part on for instance we communicate using apps and web sites if it was not one of these we will not be even communicating. Web development is creative and challenging and it requires critical thinking to solve problems, as I like challenging things. Web development is wide career with more opportunities.
